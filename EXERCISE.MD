# Product Engineer Builder Exercise (Frontend)

Timebox: ~3 hours (LLMs allowed)

## Goal
Make at least 2 concrete UI changes that unlock new value for an operator using this map-based interface.

## Setup (Browser-only)
1) Open this repo in GitHub Codespaces
2) Create a file named `.env.local` in the repo root:
   VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.XXXXXXXX
   (We will provide the token — no Mapbox account required.)
3) Run: `npm run dev`
4) Open the forwarded port preview

## Deliverable
- Open a PR with your changes
- In the PR description, include:
  - what you changed (2+ things)
  - why it matters (what decision/action it supports)
  - what you’d do next with more time
